# Project Management
## Has this happened to you before?
You attend a meeting to discuss a result that a colleague has been working on. They have emailed the figure to the group so they ask if everyone is looking at it. One person can't find the email so they share the screen so everyone can see the email attachment. They then realise that this is not the most up to date version of the figure so they spend a minute finding the latest figure on their laptop. After some useful discussion about the figure the meeting moves onto other tasks that the group is collaborating on. This involves updating the group on the progress of the tasks but none of them require discussion so it feels inefficient.

## How can we more efficiently track our tasks?
One of the most common ways to keep track of your tasks is a Kanban board. Kanban boards can be simple and track the tasks as "To Do" "In Progress" and "Done".

But they the columns can be changed to suit your needs. Here is an example of a software development Kanban board.

Having an online Kanban board will help your colleagues see what the status of your tasks are and you can upload all version of the figure in one place and get instant feedback without the need for a meeting.


## What tools can we use?
In this course we will show you how to use Trello and GitHub to more efficiently collaborate with your colleagues and manage your projects. There are other tools (such as Jira, GitHub Projects and GitLab) that may better suit your projects and we encourage you to try in the future. Once you learn how to use Trello and Github it will be easy to pick up these other tools.
