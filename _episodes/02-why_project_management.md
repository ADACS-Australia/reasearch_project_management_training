# Project Management
## Has this happened to you before?
You attend a meeting to discuss a result that a colleague has been working on. They have emailed the figure to the group so they ask if everyone is looking at it. One person can't find the email so they share the screen so everyone can see the email attachment. They then realise that this is not the most up to date version of the figure so they spend a minute finding the latest figure on their laptop. After some useful discussion about the figure the meeting moves onto other tasks that the group is collaborating on. This involves updating the group on the progress of the tasks but none of them require discussion so it feels inefficient.

## Common problems
The following are some problems you may have experienced in your research that make your work inefficient
1. Struggling to find the email with the attached plot you are looking for
2. Not being sure if this is the most up to date version of a plot
3. Struggling to keep track of your task
4. Forgetting deadlines
5. Not budgeting your time (spreading yourself too thin) so you can't work on your project
6. Struggling to keep track of who was assigned to a task
7. Unsure who is assigned to the task that is blocking you
8. Having meetings that involve updates on tasks rather than helpful discussions

## Solutions through project and data management
The following are how you can solve this problem through project and data management
1. Have a central place where all plots are kept
2. Every time an update to a plot is made, you can upload the latest version and comment on the differences
3. Track all of your tasks on a Kanban board
4. Add deadlines to all your tasks so you can see approaching deadlines at a glance
5. For each project you work on, budget a fraction of the time you plan to spend on it, and once you run out, do not take on new projects
6. Through apps like Trello, you can clearly see who is assigned to a task and its progress
7. You can see on Trello who is blocking your task and send them a comment to hurry them
8. Since you can see the progress of your tasks on the Kanban board, you do not need to talk about the progress of tasks. Your meetings can be focused on the discussion



## How can we more efficiently track our tasks?
There are several project management strategies, such as waterfall and agile, all of which have pros and cons. A common tool that many project management strategies use is Kanban boards.
Kanban boards are one of the most common ways to keep track of your tasks and can simply track tasks as "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done".

But they the columns can be changed to suit your needs. Here is an example of a software development Kanban board.

Having an online Kanban board will help your colleagues see what the status of your tasks are and you can upload all version of the figure in one place and get instant feedback without the need for a meeting.


## What tools can we use?
In this course we will show you how to use Trello and GitHub to more efficiently collaborate with your colleagues and manage your projects. There are other tools (such as Jira, GitHub Projects and GitLab) that may better suit your projects and we encourage you to try in the future. Once you learn how to use Trello and Github it will be easy to pick up these other tools.
