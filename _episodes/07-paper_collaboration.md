# Paper Collaboration

## Using a GitHub repo for the paper
It is common use some simple python to create some plots or format a csv into a latex table. When we start collaborating this can bit complicated if we have several versions of these scripts and we're emailing the scripts back on forth. It is better to make a new GitHub repo so it is easier to collaborate and version controlled. The goal of the repository should be that you can run all of the scripts and reproduce all plots, tables and results from your paper. Not only is this good software practice, it is also good research practice to make it easier for future researchers to recreate your work. A link to the GitHub page should be put in the Trello Boards description.
