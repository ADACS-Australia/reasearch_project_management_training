# GitHub
<!-- TODO Paul and I can fill out this section after we assess the skill of the students -->


# Software Collaboration
The size and scope of the software will determine which project management tools will best suit your needs. The following sections will give recomendations for different project sizes.

## Small piece of software with one collaborator
For a small number of collaborators, using GitHub Issues is likely sufficient.
<!-- TODO Put screenshots of how to make issues and how to add your own lables (priorities and bugs/enchancements) -->

## Large piece of software with several collaborators
As projects get bigger it becomes more important to keep track of issues with a Kanban board. Trello can be used and even has the option to attach branches, commits, issues and pull requests directly to cards using the GitHub Power-Up
<!-- TODO Put screenshots here -->

You can keep all of your internal goals and development discussion in Trello and leave GitHub issues for user suggestions and bug reports.

> ## Bonus note: Optional Issues Sync
> The following link describes how to set up a bot that will make a new card an a Trello Board each time a new Issue is created on a GitHub page.

<!-- TODO Mention GitHub Projects here -->
