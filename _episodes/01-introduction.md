# Acknowledgement of country
We wish to acknowledge the custodians of the land we reside on, for the developers of these lessons, these are the Wadjuk (Perth region) people of the Nyoongar nation.
We would like to pay our respect to their Elders past, present and emerging and we acknowledge and respect their continuing culture and the contribution they make to the life of this city and this region.

# Lesson Layout
This training was designed to be taught by a presenter but should be sufficient to be self-taught. If you would like to request a presenter, you can do so through the [ADACS contact page](https://adacs.org.au/#contact).
