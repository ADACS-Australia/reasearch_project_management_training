# Trello
Trello is one of the most popular project management applications thanks to it being easy to use and flexible. If you have not already, create a Trello account [here](https://trello.com/).
## Making your first workspace and board
When you first make a Trello account you will see this screen.

![trello_first_workspace](../fig/trello_first_workspace.png)

We recommend that you name your first Workspace "Personal" (you can change this later). Click continue and then skip the free trail.

You can then click "Create your first board" and name it something related to your work like "Research". There are several useful templates but for now we will show you how to make one from scratch.

You can add a description by pressing "Show Menu" (top right) and clicking on the description. You should get in the habit of adding a detailed description that includes the following details:
- Project Title
- Project Collaborators - Project team members (names, affiliations, contact details)
- Project Description
- Project Objectives
- Documentation. Links to where things live for documents, e.g. google drive, sharepoint, etc, who has access
- Data. Links to where things live for data, e.g. R drive, CloudStor, etc, who has access
- Code. Links to where things live for code, e.g. GitHub. Note all CIC code projects should be version controlled with a repository on the CIC github organisation (or other where applicable, such as the Curtin HealthHub).

## Creating cards
YOu can think of each Trello card as a single task (even if that task has several steps). Click "Add a card" and give in a simple title. You can then click on the card and give it a description.

![simple_card](../fig/simple_card.png)

You can then add to the card so it contains more information
- Members: You can assign users to cards so you can easily see who is working on task.
- Labels: The labels are customizable so you can use them in any way that you find useful. You can label you cards into types of tasks (Eg. processing, writing, researching) or urgency for example.
- Checklist: You can use checklists to keep track of which steps you have completed.
- Dates: You can set a due date and set yourself due date reminders.
- Attachments: You can attach any type file. You can attach files in comments so you can explain what changes you've made to the image and have a record of all image versions.
- Comment: You can use comments to keep notes of what you've done and even commands you've run and their output

Here is an example of what the card could look like

## Making card templates
Card templates are useful as reminders or what information to include or to save yourself time when you know you will be making a large number of similar cards.

Here is an example of a simple template
![template_card](../fig/template_card.png)
I created this template by filling in the description and clicking "Make template" at the bottom right of the card. You can now make new cards from this template and use the text as a reminder of what you should include.

Templates are also useful for keeping track of processing steps. Here is an example of a processing template which will remind you of the data to record and has a checklist to help me keep track of which step you are on.

## Creating research group workspaces
You can make a Trello workspace for your research group that will allow all workspace users to have access to all of the Trello boards within the workspace. You can make a new workspace by clicking Trello then the new workspace button.

![make_workspace](../fig/make_workspaces.png)

You can then name your workspace whatever you wish

![pulsar_workspace](../fig/pulsar_workspace.png)

Then add members by sending them an email invite

![add_members](../fig/add_members.png)

You can then create a board for every large project you have. All members of your workspace will have access to these boards.

Recomendations on how to uses these boards effectively will be covered in the following episodes
