# Trello
## Making your first workspace and board
When you first make a Trello account you will see this screen.

![trello_first_workspace](../fig/trello_first_workspace.png)

We recommend that you name your first Workspace "Personal" (you can change this later). Click continue and then skip the free trail.

You can then click "Create your first board" and name it something related to your work like "Research". There are several useful templates but for now we will show you how to make one from scratch.
