# Trello
## Making your first workspace and board
When you first make a Trello account you will see this screen.

![trello_first_workspace](../fig/trello_first_workspace.png)

We recommend that you name your first Workspace "Personal" (you can change this later). Click continue and then skip the free trail.

You can then click "Create your first board" and name it something related to your work like "Research". There are several useful templates but for now we will show you how to make one from scratch.

## Creating cards
YOu can think of each Trello card as a single task (even if that task has several steps). Click "Add a card" and give in a simple title. You can then click on the card and give it a description.

You can then add to the card so it contains more information
- Members: You can assign users to cards so you can easily see who is working on task.
- Labels: The labels are customizable so you can use them in any way that you find useful. You can label you cards into types of tasks (Eg. processing, writing, researching) or urgency for example.
- Checklist: You can use checklists to keep track of which steps you have completed.
- Dates: You can set a due date and set yourself due date reminders.
- Attachments: You can attach any type file. You can attach files in comments so you can explain what changes you've made to the image and have a record of all image versions.
- Comment: You can use comments to keep notes of what you've done and even commands you've run and their output

Here is an example of what the card could look like

## Creating research group workspaces
You can make a Trello workspace for your research group that will allow all workspace users to have access to all of the Trello boards within the workspace. You can make a new workspace by clicking Trello then the new workspace button.

You can then name your workspace whatever you wish

You can then create a board for every large project you have
