# Group Project Management
Before we discuss managing your group's individual projects, we want to think about how to manage your group on a higher level.

## Group Info Board
A group info board is a central place to keep all information relevant to your group. Think of this as a board designed to point to all the resources your collaborations uses which will be useful for both current and new collaborators. Here is an example of a Group info board:

### Documentation
In the documentation list you can include links to all documentation that is useful to your group. If your group maintains the documentation, you can note who is in charge of maintaining the documentation.

### Processing Resources
Here you can list all processing resources including super computing clusters and private servers. You should include links to their documentation and where to submit incident tickets.

### Databases
Here you can describe all of your groups databases, where you can access them and any documentation. You can also include other databases that your collaborators will find useful.

### Software repositories
It is best to keep as many as possible repositories in your group's GitHub organisation but that is not always possible. For this reason, listing all of repositories that your group uses is useful. You should include the GitHub and documentation links and the maintainers.

### Projects
For each project you can create a card which includes a link to the Trello board for that project and the person leading the project. The lead can include a summary of the project each week to update to the group on it's progress. Once they're complete they can be moved to the completed list and links to the final outputs (such as publications) can be included for future reference.
